## Editing Content Guide

The majority of this site’s text content is stored in Markdown files.

For editing purposes, here are helpful markdown file format instructions. For the most part, you can just edit the text content directly where you see it.

## Here are basic markdown rules:

## Paragraphs

For paragraphs, just type normally and leave a space in between sentence(s) to create new paragraphs.

Simple example: 

This a paragraph one. 

This is another paragraph.

## Headings

Use `#` at the start of a line:

i.e.:

```html
# Our Slow-Clooked Dishes
#   = <h1> (main home page title)
##  = <h2> (section headings)
### = <h3> (subheadings)


---

## Bold and Italic

- Bold → `**text**` → **text**
- Italic → `*text*` → _text_

---

## Special Styling

Sometimes you’ll see HTML tags within the markdown, like this:

```html
<p class="content-centered">Text here</p>
⚠️ Do not remove or edit the <p class="...">. Only edit the text inside.
